## OASIS TC Open Repository: idpf-specification

This GitHub public repository [idpf-specification](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/idpf-specification) was created at the request of the [OASIS Infrastructure Data-Plane Function (IDPF) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/idpf/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are separate and distinct from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

Contributors to this repository are expected to be Members of the OASIS IDPF TC, for any substantive change requests. Anyone wishing to contribute to this GitHub project and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join/participation-instructions">participate</a> in the TC's technical activity is invited to join as an OASIS TC Member.  Public feedback is also accepted, subject to the terms of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#appendixa">OASIS Feedback License</a>.

## Statement of Purpose

This Github Repository provides an open copy of the IDPF specification for IDPF members to review and comment on in order to clarify and complete the design. IDPF is an Open Standard for an Ethernet Interface.

This Specification document will describe the host Interface, device behavior, setup, and configuration flows of IDPF PCIE network function device. This device can be presented to an OS as a PCIe Physical function (PF) device or a virtual function (VF) device from a NIC/Smart NIC/IPU/DPU or as a completely emulated device in Host SW. An IDPF device is OS and Vendor Agnostic.

Goals for IDPF Github are to:

1. Be able to review and get feedback on the Spec from various members in a code review style fashion.
2. Keep the process open and transparent.
3. Take the Spec to 1.0 level
4. Future extensions beyond 1.0 for new features as the offloads onto the device get expanded. Example: Crypto offload, RDMA etc.
